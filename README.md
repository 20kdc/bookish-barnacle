# bookish-barnacle

little player by 20kdc to play ry00001's informal video format
in as silly a manner as possible

expects `videos/NAME/music.ogg` (audio file for LOVE to play; duration overrides video duration)
`videos/NAME/video.bin` (video file in ry00001's video format)
`videos/NAME/fps.txt` (20kdc extension to choose FPS; just has the FPS as a number)
`video.txt` (just says "NAME" ; useful for switching videos)

the shell scripts `convert.sh` and `play.sh` are useful utilities but are not necessary

tested on (i.e. expected to be run in) LOVE 11.1 Mysterious Mysteries
